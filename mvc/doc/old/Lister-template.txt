When you use lister, you should specify it with a template:

<table>
 <?lister?>
  <?row?>
    <td><?$id?></td>
    <td><?$name?></td>
    <td><?$surname?></td>
  <?/row?>
  .. junk ..
 <?/lister?>
</table>

In this scenario, lister would replace <?lister?> region with as many rows as needed. Here is how you add lister on the page

$page->add('Lister',null,'lister','row');

If you want to add lister to a blank page and want it to handle more than just rows, use CompleteLister instead
